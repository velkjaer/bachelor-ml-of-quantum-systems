Once constructed, neural network potentials can provide the energies and forces many orders of magnitude faster than electronic structure calculations, and thus enable molecular dynamics simulations of large systems. However, Cartesian coordinates are not a good choice to represent the atomic positions, and a transformation to symmetry functions is required. Using simple benchmark systems, the properties of several types of symmetry functions suitable for the construction of high-dimensional neural network potential-energy surfaces are discussed in detail.

They offer a number of advantages: they are very general and applicable to systems as different as small molecules, semiconductors and metals; they are numerically very accurate and fast to evaluate; and they can be constructed using any electronic structure method. Significant progress has been made in recent years and a number of successful applications demonstrate the capabilities of neural network potentials.

Through the combination of principal component analysis and recursive partitioning using a small dataset comprised of intrinsic material properties, we develop a decision tree-based model comprised of if-then rules which estimates the friction coefficients of a wide range of materials. This data-driven model has a high degree of accuracy with an R (2) value of 0.8904 and provides a range of possible friction coefficients that accounts for the possible variability of a material's actual friction coefficient.},

The train dataset was reduced by employing two times similarity and the reduced dataset was utilized with support vector machine to predict global solar radiation. Additionally, the proposed method was validated by employing neural network, linear regression, k nearest neighbor, extreme learning machine, Gaussian process regression and kernel smooth regression. This study was showed that the machine learning methods can be used instead of long term measurement before investments.},

Aiming toward this goal, we develop and apply a systematic hierarchy of efficient empirical methods to estimate atomization and total energies of molecules. These methods range from a simple sum over atoms, to addition of bond energies, to pairwise interatomic force fields, reaching to the more sophisticated machine learning approaches that are capable of describing collective interactions between many atoms or bonds. In the case of equilibrium molecular geometries, even simple pairwise force fields demonstrate prediction accuracy comparable to benchmark energies calculated using density functional theory with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals; however, accounting for the collective many-body interactions proves to be essential for approaching the "holy grail" of chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol for both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium geometries. This remarkable accuracy is achieved by a vectorized representation of molecules (so-called Bag of Bonds model) that exhibits strong nonlocality in chemical space. In addition, the same representation allows us to predict accurate electronic properties of molecules, such as their polarizability and molecular frontier orbital energies.},

A central challenge of such approaches is to develop a numerical representation, often referred to as a fingerprint, of the materials. Inspired by recent developments in cheminformatics, we propose a class of hierarchical motif-based topological fingerprints for materials composed of elements such as C, O, H, N, F, etc., whose coordination preferences are well understood. We show that these fingerprints, when representing either molecules or crystals, may be effectively mapped onto a variety of properties using a similarity-based learning model and hence can be used to predict the relevant properties of a material, given that its fingerprint can be defined. Two simple machine-learning-based procedures are introduced to demonstrate that the learning model can be inverted to identify the desired fingerprints and then to reconstruct molecules which possess a set of targeted properties.},

The input variables for the network were the chemical elements crud the weld cooling rate. The outputs consisted of the yield and ultimate tensile strengths, elongation, and reduction of area. Many models here created using different network configurations and initial conditions. An appropriate committee of models was then assembled by testing the ability of the models to generalise on unseen data. The neural network technique used is due to MacKay, with a Bayesian framework, and hence allows the estimation of error bars, which warn the user when data are sparse or locally noisy. The method revealed significant trends describing the dependence of mechanical properties on weld composition and cooling rate.},

  abstract  = {I present a computational study on atomic order in 2-nm cuboctahedral Au-Pd nanoparticles. Equilibrium atomic structures, energies, and electronic surface d-band centers have been calculated across the entire range of compositions at different temperatures using a Bayesian approach to cluster expansions. The estimated prediction error in formation energies calculated by the cluster expansion, relative to density functional theory, is approximately 1 meV/atom. This prediction error would be low for a cluster expansion on a bulk material, and it is exceptionally low for a study of nanoparticles of this size. This result was accomplished by extending the Bayesian approach for cluster expansions to account for nonlocal, composition-dependent effects that might otherwise not be captured. For this system the Bayesian approach is estimated to be approximately five times as efficient as more common cluster selection techniques.},

Complex materials problems can be approached much more efficiently and broadly through the sheer quantity of structures and chemistries available in such databases. Our HT DFT database, the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), contains over 200,000 DFT calculated crystal structures and will be freely available for public use at                   http://oqmd.org                                  . In this review, we describe the OQMD and its use in five materials problems, spanning a wide range of applications and materials types: (I) Li-air battery combination catalyst/electrodes, (II) Li-ion battery anodes, (III) Li-ion battery cathode coatings reactive with HF, (IV) Mg-alloy long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) strengthening precipitates, and (V) training a machine learning model to predict new stable ternary compounds.},

  abstract  = {The cluster expansion (CE) method has been used to evaluate configurational properties in multicomponent systems based on the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Appropriate selections of not only clusters but also structures for DFT calculations (DFT structures) are crucial for the accuracy and the efficiency of the CE. In a conventional procedure to construct the CE, the CE error is reduced mainly through an appropriate selection of clusters. In the present paper, we propose an improved procedure that systematically leads to optimal selections of both clusters and DFT structures. DFT structures are chosen to cover as much of the configurational space as possible. During the iterative process, the predictive power of the out-of-sample structures can be increased up to the accuracy that is required to describe alloy thermodynamics. We apply the procedure to configurational behaviors in a simple MgO-ZnO pseudobinary system and in a complex MgAl2O4 system. The CE error is reduced in both systems, in particular, in the complex system, thereby significantly improving configurational properties at high temperatures compared with the conventional CE procedure.},

Attention is given to considerations of the optimum semiconductor material for solar energy conversion and how it changes with operating temperature. Experimental results are presented showing operating characteristics and conversion efficiencies of such materials as silicon, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, cadmium sulfide, and others. The high voltage (â¼100-v) photovoltaic effect from evaporated CdTe films is described. Included is a discussion of the major problems yet to be solved. }
