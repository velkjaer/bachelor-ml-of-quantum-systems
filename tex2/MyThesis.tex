\usepackage[numbers, sort&compress]{natbib}
%    round: (default) for round parentheses;
%    square: for square brackets;
%    curly: for curly braces;
%    angle: for angle brackets;
%    colon: (default) to separate multiple citations with colons;
%    comma: to use commas as separaters;
%    authoryear: (default) for author-year citations;
%    numbers: for numerical citations;
%    super: for superscripted numerical citations, as in Nature;
%    sort: orders multiple citations into the sequence in which they appear in the list of references;
%    sort&compress: as sort but in addition multiple numerical citations are compressed if possible (as 3-6, 15);
%    longnamesfirst: makes the first citation of any reference the equivalent of the starred variant (full author list) and subsequent citations normal (abbreviated list);
%    sectionbib: redefines \thebibliography to issue \section* instead of \chapter*; valid only for classes with a \chapter command; to be used with the chapterbib package;
%    nonamebreak: keeps all the authors' names in a citation on one line; causes overfull hboxes but helps with some hyperref problems.
