  Abstract                 = {Highly efficient washing and extraction of microbeads to decomplex analytes ranging from small peptides to large viruses was realised in a microscaled continuous flow format. The bead washing principle reported herein is based on acoustophoresis, i.e. the primary acoustic radiation force in an ultrasonic standing wave and laminar flow properties are utilised to translate bioanalytes trapped on functionalised microbeads from one carrier fluid to another. The carry-over of non-specific material ranges from 1 to 50 ppm relative to input levels depending on application, making acoustophoresis suitable for extraction of rare species from complex environments. Selective extraction of a phosphopeptide relative to its unphosphorylated counterpart is demonstrated using metal oxide affinity capture {(MOAC)} beads and {MALDI-TOF} {MS} readout. Acoustophoresis of microbeads activated with specific binders could be used to capture phage viral particles. The efficiency of the acoustophoretic washing principle was demonstrated by an unspecific phage cross contamination level of only 10(-6) of that in the input bead/phage mixture. The continuous flow format makes acoustophoretic washing flexible regarding sample volume and also allows for easy integration into a sequence of particle handling and analytical unit operations.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustophoresis is a method well suited for cell and microbead separation or concentration for downstream analysis in microfluidic settings. One of the main limitations that acoustophoresis share with other microfluidic techniques is that the separation efficiency is poor for particle-rich suspensions. We report that flow laminated liquids can be relocated in a microchannel when exposed to a resonant acoustic field. Differences in acoustic impedance between two liquids cause migration of the high-impedance liquid towards an acoustic pressure node. In a set of experiments we charted this phenomenon and show herein that it can be used to either relocate liquids with respect to each other{,} or to stabilize the interface between them. This resulted in decreased medium carry-over when transferring microbeads (4% by volume) between suspending liquids using acoustophoresis. Furthermore we demonstrate that acoustic relocation of liquids occurs for impedance differences as low as 0.1%.},

  Abstract                 = {{Bulk viscosity is a somewhat obscure parameter that appears in the hydrodynamic equations for Newtonian liquids when compressibility is important and, together with the dynamic viscosity, controls sound attenuation. Whereas dynamic viscosity reflects only ``translational{''} molecular motion, in contrast the bulk viscosity reflects the relaxation of both ``rotational{''} and ``vibrational{''} degrees of molecular freedom. Several molecular theories yield predictive expressions for both bulk and dynamic viscosities, but experimentally the situation is quite out of balance, in that there is extensive data for the dynamic viscosity of all sorts of liquids, but a paucity of data for bulk viscosity, just a few values for water and a handful of exotic liquids. We compare three possible experimental techniques for measuring bulk viscosity, namely, Brillouin spectroscopy, Laser transient grating spectroscopy, and acoustic spectroscopy. We then formulate some arguments suggesting that acoustic spectroscopy is not only the most suitable for measuring bulk viscosity, but that it also offers a verification procedure that can confirm that the measured parameter agrees with theoretical definition of bulk viscosity for a Newtonian liquid. In addition, acoustic spectroscopy provides a measurement of sound speed, which cannot only improve the attenuation measurement but as a side benefit can also be used to calculate liquid compressibility. We apply this technique for measuring the bulk viscosity and compressibility of twelve commonly assumed Newtonian liquids, two of which surprisingly fails to pass a verification test described here to test the Newtonian hypothesis. Then, we test correlation between measured bulk viscosity and several other intensive properties of these liquids, such as density, dynamic viscosity, dielectric permittivity, and compressibility. We have not discovered any meaningful correlation. This suggests that bulk viscosity is an independent parameter that reflects peculiar properties of liquids and can be used in the set of independent equations describing molecular interaction in liquids.}},

  Abstract                 = {Microparticles (MP) are small (100-1000 nm) membrane vesicles shed by cells as a response to activation{,} stress or apoptosis. Platelet-derived MP (PMP) has been shown to reflect the pathophysiological processes of a range of cardiovascular diseases and there is a potential clinical value in using PMPs as biomarkers{,} as well as a need to better understand the biology of these vesicles. The current method for isolating MP depends on differential centrifugation steps{,} which require relatively large sample volumes and have been shown to compromise the integrity and composition of the MP population. We present a novel method for rapid{,} non-contact capture of PMP in minute sample volumes based on a microscale acoustic standing wave technology. Capture of PMPs from plasma is shown by scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry. Furthermore{,} the system is characterized with regards to plasma sample concentration and flow rate. Finally{,} the technique is compared to a standard differential centrifugation protocol using samples from both healthy controls and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patient samples. The acoustic system is shown to offer a quick and automated setup for extracting microparticles from small sample volumes with higher recovery than a standard differential centrifugation protocol.},

  Abstract                 = {{We present here an in-depth analysis of particle levitation stability
 and the role of the radial and axial forces exerted on fixed spherical
 and ellipsoidal particles levitated in an axisymmetric acoustic
 levitator, over a wide range of particle sizes and surrounding medium
 viscosities. We show that the stability behaviour of a levitated
 particle in an axisymmetric levitator is unequivocally connected to the
 radial forces: the loss of levitation stability is always due to the
 change of the radial force sign from positive to negative. It is found
 that the axial force exerted on a sphere of radius R-s increases with
 increasing viscosity for R-s/lambda < 0.0125 (lambda is the acoustic
 wavelength), with the viscous contribution of this force scaling with
 the inverse of the sphere radius. The axial force decreases with
 increasing viscosity for spheres with R-s/lambda > 0.0125. The radial
 force, on the other hand, decreases monotonically with increasing
 viscosity. The radial and axial forces exerted on an ellipsoidal
 particle are larger than those exerted on a volume-equivalent sphere, up
 to the point where the ellipsoid starts to act as an obstacle to the
 formation of the standing wave in the levitator chamber.}},

The primary aim of the method is to increase the accuracy and dynamic range by locally adopting the particle image displacement for each interrogation window to overcome the largest drawback of PIV. This is required in order to resolve flow phenomena which have so far remained inaccessible. The method locally optimizes the temporal separation between the particle image pairs by taking first and second order effects into account. The validation of the evaluation method is performed with synthetically generated particle image sequences based on the solution of a direct numerical simulation. In addition, the performance of the evaluation approach is demonstrated by means of a real image sequence measured with a time-resolved PIV system.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Acoustic streaming generated by standing waves in channels of arbitrary width is investigated analytically. In a previous paper by the authors {[}J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 113, 153-160 (2003)], a purely viscous fluid in a two-dimensional channel was considered. That analysis is extended here to a gas in which heat conduction and dependence of the viscosity on temperature are taken into account. Calculations are presented for typical working gases used in thermoacoustic engines at standard temperature and pressure. In channels that are very wide in comparison with the viscous penetration depth, which is the Rayleigh streaming regime, the influence of the two thermal effects is comparable but small. The same is true in very narrow channels, having widths on the order of the viscous penetration depth. In channels having intermediate widths, 10-20 times the viscous penetration depth, the effect of heat conduction can be substantial. The analysis is performed for cylindrical tubes as well as two-dimensional channels, and the results are found to be qualitatively the same. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America.}},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic trapping of submicron particles can allow enrichment and purification of small-sized and low-abundant microorganisms. In this paper, we investigate the dependency of the ability to capture submicron particles on the particle concentration. Based on the findings, it is demonstrated that seed particles can be introduced, in acoustic trapping, to enable capture of low abundant submicron particles. Without using seed particles, continuous enrichment of 490 nm polystyrene particles is demonstrated in a rectangular capillary with a locally generated acoustic field at high particle concentrations, i.e. above 1 %wt. Trapping of submicron particles at significantly lower concentrations was subsequently accomplished by seeding 10-12 micrometer-sized particles in the acoustic trap prior to the submicron particle capture. Further, the new seed particle aided acoustic trapping technique was employed for the continuous enrichment of bacteria (E. coli) with a capture efficiency of 95 %. Finally, seed particle assisted acoustic trapping and enrichment is demonstrated for polymer-based particles down to 110 nm in diameter.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-contact trapping using acoustic standing waves has shown promising results in cell-based research lately. However, the devices demonstrated are normally fabricated using microfabrication or precision machining methods leading to a high unit cost. In e. g. clinical or forensic applications avoiding cross-contamination, carryover or infection is of outmost importance. In these applications disposable devices are key elements, thus making the cost per unit a critical factor. A solution is presented here where low-cost off-the-shelf glass capillaries are used as resonators for standing wave trapping. Single-mode as well as multi-node trapping is demonstrated with an excellent agreement between simulated and experimentally found operation frequencies. Single particle trapping is verified at 7.53 MHz with a trapping force on a 10 mm particle of up to 1.27 nN. The non-contact trapping is proved using confocal microscopy. Finally, an application is presented where the capillary is used as a pipette for aspirating, trapping and dispensing red blood cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite its fundamental role in the dynamics of compressible fluids, bulk viscosity has received little experimental attention and there remains a paucity of measured data. Acoustic spectroscopy provides a robust and accurate approach to measuring this parameter. Working from the Navier-Stokes model of a compressible fluid one can show that the bulk viscosity makes a significant and measurable contribution to the frequency-squared acoustic attenuation. Here we employ this methodology to determine the bulk viscosity of Millipore water over a temperature range of 7 to 50°C. The measured attenuation spectra are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the bulk viscosity of water is found to be approximately three times larger than its shear counterpart, reinforcing its significance in acoustic propagation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that this technique can be readily and generally applied to fluids to accurately determine their temperature dependent bulk viscosities.},

  Abstract                 = {The capture of 200 nm biotinylated latex beads from suspensions of concentration 10(7) to 2.5 x 10(8) particle/ml on an immuno-coated surface of the acoustic reflector in an ultrasound standing wave (USW) resonator has been studied while the acoustic pathlength was less than one half wavelength (lambda/2). The particles were delivered to the reflector's surface by acoustically induced flow. The capture dependencies on suspension concentration, duration of experiments and acoustic pressure have been established at 1.09, 1.46 and 1.75 MHz. Five-fold capture increase has been obtained at 1.75 MHz in comparison to the control (no ultrasound) situation. The contrasting behaviours of 1, 0.5 and 0.2 mum fluorescent latex beads in a lambda/4 USW resonator at 1.46 MHz have been characterized. The particle movements were observed with an epi-fluorescent microscope and the velocities of the particles were measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). The experiments showed that whereas the trajectories of 1 mum particles were mainly affected by the direct radiation force, 0.5 mum particles were influenced both by the radiation force and acoustic streaming. The 0.2 mum latex beads followed acoustic streaming in the chamber and were not detectably affected by the radiation force. The streaming-associated behaviour of the 200 nm particles has implications for enhanced immunocapture of viruses and macromolecules (both of which are also too small to experience significant acoustic radiation force).},

  Abstract                 = {A new model for calculating the density of aqueous solutions of electrolytes has been developed. Parameters for 59 electrolytes were established on the basis of an extensive critical review of the published literature for solutions of one electrolyte in water, with over 10 700 points included. The average difference between the calculated and experimental density of solutions of water and one electrolyte is 0.10 kg m(-3) with a standard deviation of 1.44 kg m(-3). The model was validated by predicting the density of systems of two or more electrolytes in water. The average difference between experimental and calculated values for over 1600 points is 0.003 kg m(-3) with a standard deviation of 1.39 kg m(-3). The electrolytes studied are AlCl3, Al-2(SO4)(3), BaCl2, CaCl2, CdCl2, CdSO4, CoCl2, CoSO4, CrCl3, Cr-2(SO4)(3), CuCl2, CuSO4, FeCl2, FeSO4, FeCl3, Fe-2(SO4)(3), HCl, HCN, HNO3, H3PO4, H2SO4, KCl, K2CO3, KNO3, KOH, K2SO4, LiCl, Li2SO4, MgCl2, MgSO4, MnCl2, MnSO4, NaBr, NaCl, NaClO3, Na2CO3, NaF, NaHCO3, NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, NaHSO3, NaI, Na2MoO4, NaNO2, NaNO3, NaOH, Na3PO4, Na2SO3, Na2S2O3, Na2SO4, NH3, NH4Cl, NH4NO3, (NH4)(2)SO4, NiCl2, NiSO4, SrCl2, ZnCl2, and ZnSO4.},

  Abstract                 = {{In acoustofluidic manipulation and sorting devices, Rayleigh streaming flows are typically found in addition to the acoustic radiation forces. However, experimental work from various groups has described acoustic streaming that occurs in planar devices in a plane parallel to the transducer face. This is typically a four-quadrant streaming pattern with the circulation parallel to the transducer. Understanding its origins is essential for creating designs that limit or control this phenomenon. The cause of this kind of streaming pattern has not been previously explained as it is different from the well-known classical streaming patterns such as Rayleigh streaming and Eckart streaming, whose circulation planes are generally perpendicular to the face of the acoustic transducer. In order to gain insight into these patterns we present a numerical method based on Nyborg's limiting velocity boundary condition that includes terms ignored in the Rayleigh analysis, and verify its predictions against experimental PIV results in a simple device. The results show that the modelled particle trajectories match those found experimentally. Analysis of the dominant terms in the driving equations shows that the origin of this kind of streaming pattern is related to the circulation of the acoustic intensity.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This article discusses three-dimensional (3D) boundary-driven streaming in acoustofluidic devices. Firstly, the 3D Rayleigh streaming pattern in a microchannel is simulated and its effect on the movement of microparticles of various sizes is demonstrated. The results obtained from this model show good comparisons with 3D experimental visualisations and demonstrate the fully 3D nature of the acoustic streaming field and the associated acoustophoretic motion of microparticles in acoustofluidic devices. This method is then applied to another acoustofluidic device in order to gain insights into an unusual in-plane streaming pattern. The origin of this streaming has not been fully described and its characteristics cannot be explained from the classical theory of Rayleigh streaming. The simulated in-plane streaming pattern was in good agreement with the experimental visualisation. The mechanism behind it is shown to be related to the active sound intensity field, which supports our previous findings on the mechanism of the in-plane acoustic streaming pattern visualised and modelled in a thin-layered capillary device.}},

Fundamental advances in the development of elastomer based microfluidics have been driving factors for making microfluidic technology available to a larger scientific community in the past years. In line with this, microfluidic separation of cells and particles is currently developing rapidly where key areas of interest are found in designing lab-on-a-chip systems that offer controlled microenvironments for studies of fundamental cell biology. More recently industrial interests are seen in the development of micro chip based flow cytometry technology both for preclinical research and clinical diagnostics. This critical review outlines the most recent developments in microfluidic technology for cell and particle separation in continuous flow based systems. (130 references)}},

  Abstract                 = {Sound can levitate objects of different sizes and materials through air, water and tissue. This allows us to manipulate cells, liquids, compounds or living things without touching or contaminating them. However, acoustic levitation has required the targets to be enclosed with acoustic elements or had limited manoeuvrability. Here we optimize the phases used to drive an ultrasonic phased array and show that acoustic levitation can be employed to translate, rotate and manipulate particles using even a single-sided emitter. Furthermore, we introduce the holographic acoustic elements framework that permits the rapid generation of traps and provides a bridge between optical and acoustical trapping. Acoustic structures shaped as tweezers, twisters or bottles emerge as the optimum mechanisms for tractor beams or containerless transportation. Single-beam levitation could manipulate particles inside our body for applications in targeted drug delivery or acoustically controlled micro-machines that do not interfere with magnetic resonance imaging.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrasonic scattering theory is used to relate the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation of emulsions to their physical properties (e.g. droplet size and volume fraction). This theory includes visco-inertial and thermal scattering mechanisms and corrections due to multiple scattering. The physical significance of the scattering mechanisms is discussed so as to highlight the factors which influence ultrasonic measurements in these systems. Theoretical predictions were compared with experimental measurements of velocity and attenuation in sunflower oil in water emulsions with varying droplet radii (0.14-0.74 mu m), mass fraction (0-0.5) and frequency (1.25-10.0 MHz) at 293.1 K. Appreciable excess attenuation and velocity dispersion were observed which could be attributed to thermal scattering. The relationship between the measurable ultrasonic parameters and the physical properties of emulsions means ultrasonic scattering should prove a useful means of investigating these systems.},

We assume spherical symmetry and a coupling of the bubble oscillations. Our results show that the strength and even the directions of the resulting secondary Bjerknes forces differ considerably from predictions of the well-known linear theory.

  Abstract                 = {{We characterize and quantify the performance of ultrasonic particle aggregation and positioning in a 100-well microplate. We analyze the result when operating a planar ultrasonic ring transducer at different single actuation frequencies in the range 2.20-2.40 MHz, and compare with the result obtained from different schemes of frequency-modulated actuation. Compared to our previously used wedge transducer design, the ring transducer has a larger contact area facing the microplate, resulting in lower temperature increase for a given actuation voltage. Furthermore, we analyze the dynamics of acoustic streaming occurring simultaneously with the particle trapping in the wells of the microplate, and we define an adaptive ultrasonic actuation scheme for optimizing both efficiency and robustness of the method. The device is designed as a tool for ultrasound-mediated cell aggregation and positioning. This is a method for high-resolution optical characterization of time-dependent cellular processes at the level of single cells. In this paper, we demonstrate how to operate our device in order to optimize the scanning time of 3D confocal microscopy with the aim to perform high-resolution time-lapse imaging of cells or cell-cell interactions in a highly parallel manner.}},

  Abstract                 = {{As originally realized by Nyborg (J. Acoust. Soc. Am., vol. 30, 1958, P. 329), the problem of the inner acoustic/steady streaming can be analysed in quite general terms. The inner streaming is the one that develops in the high-frequency limit in a thin Stokes (shear-wave) layer at a boundary, in contrast to the outer streaming in the main bulk of the fluid. The analysis provides relevant inner-streaming characteristics through a given distribution of the acoustic amplitude along the boundary. Here such a generalized treatment is revisited for a motionless boundary. By working in terms of surface vectors, though in elementary notations, new compact and easy-to-use expressions are obtained. The most important ones are those for the effective (apparent) slip velocity at the boundary as seen from a perspective of the main bulk of the fluid, which is often the sole driving factor behind the outer streaming, and for the induced (acoustic) steady tangential stress on the boundary. As another novel development, non-adiabatic effects in the Stokes layer are taken into account, which become apparent through the fluctuating density and viscosity perturbations, and whose contribution into the streaming is often ignored in the literature. Some important particular cases, such as the axisymmetric case and the incompressible case, are emphasized. As far as the application of the derived general inner-streaming expressions is concerned, a few examples provided here involve a plane acoustic standing wave, which either grazes a wall parallel to its direction (convenient for the estimation of the non-adiabatic effects), or into which a small (compared to the acoustic wavelength) rigid sphere is placed. If there are simultaneously two such waves, out-of-phase and, say, in mutually orthogonal directions, a disk placed coplanarly with them will undergo a steady torque, which is calculated here as another example. Two further examples deal with translational high-frequency harmonic vibrations of particles relative to an incompressible fluid medium, viz, of a rigid oblate spheroid (along its axis) and of a sphere (arbitrary three dimensional). The latter can be a fixed rigid sphere, one free to rotate or even a (viscous) spherical drop, for which the outer streaming and the internal circulation are also considered.}},

In particular, the use of the singular perturbation technique for this class of problems is delineated with a set of examples where fluid-fluid interaction takes place. In this category, we focus on drops and bubbles, and deal specifically with the effect of interfacial mobility on the streaming flow.},
